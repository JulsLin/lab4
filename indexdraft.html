    <p>
      Hello, my name is Julianna Lin. I was born and raised in Vancouver, BC. I have a
      lot of passions in life but one of my <em>favourite</em> pastime is to
      curl up on the couch in front of the fireplace with a good book. But now I do not 
      have much time for reading since I have <strong>tons</strong> of course work from BCIT.
    </p>
    <p>Here are some of the courses I'm taking:</p>
