          Hello, my name is Julianna Lin. I was born and raised in Vancouver,
          BC. I have a lot of passions in life but one of my
          <em>favourite</em> pastime is to curl up on the couch in front of the
          fireplace with a good book. But now I do not have much time for
          reading since I have <strong>tons</strong> of course work from BCIT.

        <h3>A little bit more about me</h3>

          Here is a picture of my daughter and I on her 2nd birthday.
        </p>

        <p>
          Right now my life is consumed with school and my daughter. It is a
          little hard to balance everything but I learned to do it with time
          management.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since we have summer off, I will be taking my daughter to Taiwan with
          me to visit our family. She has never been to another
          country before, so this will be an adventure for her. I have been to
          Taiwan 4 times in my life since my grandparents are from there. While
          I visit Taiwan, I also try to visit another country in Asia at the
          same time.
