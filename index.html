          Hello, my name is Julianna Lin. I was born and raised in Vancouver,
          BC. I have a lot of passions in life but one of my
          <em>favourite</em> pastime is to curl up on the couch in front of the
          fireplace with a good book. But now I do not have much time for
          reading since I have <strong>tons</strong> of course work from BCIT.

          Right now my life is consumed with school and my daughter. It is a
          little hard to balance everything but I learned to do it with time
          management.

          Since we have summer off, I will be taking my daughter to Taiwan with
          me to visit our family. She has never been to another country before,
          so this will be an adventure for her. I have been to Taiwan 4 times in
          my life since my grandparents are from there. While I visit Taiwan, I
          also try to visit another country in Asia at the same time.
