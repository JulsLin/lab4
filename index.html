              Hello, my name is Julianna Lin. I was born and raised in
              Vancouver, BC. I have a lot of passions in life but one of my
              <em>favourite</em> pastime is to curl up on the couch in front of
              the fireplace with a good book. But now I do not have much time
              for reading since I have <strong>tons</strong> of course work from
              BCIT.
            </p>

              Since we have summer off, I will be taking my daughter to Taiwan
              with me to visit our family. She has never been to another country
              before, so this will be an adventure for her. I have been to
              Taiwan 4 times in my life since my grandparents are from there.
              While I visit Taiwan, I also try to visit another country in Asia
              at the same time.
